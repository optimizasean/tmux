Here is how I do my tmux.
I recommend you check the config file and look at the plugins I use.

tmux-sensible is the base configuration (for sensible tmux bindings).

tmux-ressurect to save sessions and layouts (mostly layout savior).

tmux-pain-control and tmux-sensible saves lots of pain with pains and
is great for the vim friendly.

You may also like my [vim configuration](https://github.com/optimizasea/vim)
or my [neovim configuration](https://github.com/optimizasean/nvim) which is
a bit more modern, faster, and cleaner (thanks to neovim)!

Enjoy!
